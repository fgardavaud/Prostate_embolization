# Prerequisite

Several R packages are mandatory but the script analyze your system and installs, if necessary, missing packages. In your project root path you have to create one folder named "data" (and put your data here) and another folder named "output" where the output files will be placed there.

# test environment

This script have been tested in R 4.0.4 version in Rstudio v1.4.1106 in macOS Mojave and Catalina version. But it should work on any OS system if your R program have the ability to work with additional R packages
